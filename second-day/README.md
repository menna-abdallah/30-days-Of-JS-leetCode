This document introduces key JavaScript concepts: closures, lexical environments, and execution contexts. These concepts are essential for understanding how JavaScript manages variables, functions, and their scope.

## 1. Lexical Environment

A **lexical environment** is a data structure that stores all variables and function declarations. It allows the JavaScript interpreter to recognize which variables or functions are accessible in different scopes.

### Components of a Lexical Environment:
- **Environment Record**: Stores variables and functions declared within the current scope.
- **Reference to Outer Environment**: If a variable is not found in the current environment, JavaScript looks for it in the outer environment, continuing this process until it reaches the global environment.

## 2. Execution Context

An **execution context** represents the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

### Types of Execution Contexts:
- **Global Execution Context**:
  - Created when JavaScript code is first executed.
  - Contains everything defined in the global scope (e.g., globally declared variables and functions).
  - There is only one global execution context.
  - In browsers, the global object is `window`; in Node.js, it is `global`.

- **Function Execution Context**:
  - Created whenever a function is invoked.
  - Each invocation creates a new execution context.
  - Includes local variables, arguments, and inner functions.
  - The execution context is destroyed when the function finishes execution.

### Execution Phases:
1. **Creation Phase**:
   - The variable environment and lexical environment are set.
2. **Execution Phase**:
   - JavaScript executes the code line by line, assigning values to variables and running functions.

## 3. Scope

Scope determines the visibility of variables and defines where they can be accessed or referenced.

### Types of Scopes:
- **Global Scope**: Variables and functions declared outside any function or block. Accessible throughout the code.
- **Local Scope**: Variables and functions accessible only within specific parts of the code, such as inside a function or block.
- **Function Scope**: Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside a block `{}` (introduced in ES6 with `let` and `const`).
- **Lexical Scope**: Scope is determined by where a variable or function is declared, not where it is executed.

## 4. Variables Lifetime

### Global Variables:
- **Lifetime**: Created when the program starts and persist throughout the execution of the script.
- **Scope**: Accessible from anywhere in the program.

### Local Variables (Function Scope):
- **Lifetime**: Created when a function is invoked and destroyed once the function finishes execution.
- **Scope**: Accessible only within the function where they are declared.

## 5. Closures

A **closure** is a feature that allows functions to "remember" variables from the environment in which they were created. Closures extend the lifetime of local variables.

### Key Concepts of Closures:
- Functions retain access to variables from their outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
- Variables are captured by reference, not by value.
- Closures allow data persistence between function calls without exposing it to the global scope.
- Commonly used in callbacks, event handlers, and function currying.

### Example:
```javascript
function outer() {
    let count = 0;
    return function inner() {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}
const counter = outer();
counter();  // Output: 1
counter();  // Output: 2
```

In this example, the `inner` function forms a closure over the variable `count`, allowing it to retain the value of `count` between calls, even though `outer` has finished executing.

This overview helps explain how JavaScript handles variable scope, function execution, and closures, which are crucial for writing effective and modular JavaScript code.
